# VerifAI: Revolutionizing Intellectual Property Management

VerifAI is a groundbreaking project aimed at transforming the issuance and management of intellectual property by leveraging blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. This comprehensive platform addresses key challenges in the current market, including transparency, duplication, and accountability.

## Key Features

### 1. Issuance of Soul Bound Tokens (SBTs)
- Only whitelisted organizations, defined in a smart contract, have the authority to issue SBTs.
- SBTs can be issued individually or in bulk minting processes.
- Bulk minting involves uploading a CSV file containing necessary fields such as address, type of SBT, and description. SBTs are then distributed in multi-batch transactions.

### 2. Portfolio Management
- Users have access to a dedicated portfolio website where they can view and manage their SBTs.
- The portfolio allows users to search for SBTs issued by other individuals or organizations.

### 3. Verification Module
- Each SBT is equipped with a 'Generate Proof' button, enabling the generation of a QR code as proof of authenticity.
- The QR code can be scanned to verify the legitimacy of the SBT, ensuring transparency and trust.

### 4. AI-Based Reputation Module
- A dynamic reputation scoring system incentivizes users to contribute quality work and publish valuable papers.
- Reputation scores are calculated based on various parameters, including the number and type of SBTs owned by a user.
- AI algorithms analyze web data to determine the popularity index of different domains, influencing reputation scores.
- Higher reputation scores enable users to discover high-quality authors and papers on the platform, enhancing transparency and trust.

## Integration with India Stack
VerifAI is proposed as an integrated solution with India Stack, a collection of open APIs and digital public goods focused on identity, data, and payments. This integration ensures government and organizational compliance, making VerifAI the standard platform for publishing intellectual property in India.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementation of AI algorithms to assess the quality of papers before publishing them as SBTs.
- Introduction of a like-dislike feature to further refine the reputation scoring module, facilitating community-driven quality assessment.
